        <p>Czech-in Map is the main application of the website. User can visualize all venues I've visited and all breweries I've tasted beer from. 
            The left panel provides a variety of filters that can be used to visualize only certain data sets. 
            The right panel then displays check-in details after clicking on a specific beer name in the feature's pop-up windows.
