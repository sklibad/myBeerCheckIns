            <h3>Lager/Pilsner</h3>
            <p>Lagers are a newer style of beer with two key differences from ales. Lagers ferment for a long time at a low temperature, 
                and they rely on bottom-fermenting yeasts, which sink to the bottom of the fermenting tank to do their magic.</p>
            <p>A subspecies of lager, pilsner beers are distinguished by their water, which varies from neutral to hard. 
                Pilsners are among the hoppiest lagers and generally have a dry, slightly bitter flavor.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "beer-style">
            <h3>Ale</h3>
            <p>Ale is a general category of beer: You'll find sub-categories like brown ales or pale ales. 
                This is the oldest style of beer, which dates back to antiquity. What distinguishes an ale - 
                and also makes this category of beer accessible for home brewers - is a warm-temperature fermentation 
                for a relatively short period of time. In the brewing process, brewers introduce top-fermenting yeasts which, as the name suggests, 
                ferment on the top of the brew. The fermentation process turns what would otherwise be a barley and malt tea into a boozy beverage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "beer-style">
            <h3>APA</h3>
            <p>American Pale Ale, which is somewhat of a hybrid between the traditional English pale ale and the IPA style. 
                American pale ales are hoppier and usually feature American two row malt.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "beer-style">
            <h3>IPA</h3>
            <p>Originally, India Pale Ale or IPA was a British pale ale brewed with extra hops. 
                High levels of this bittering agent made the beer stable enough to survive the long boat trip to India without spoiling. 
                The extra dose of hops gives IPA beers their bitter taste. Depending on the style of hops used, IPAs may have fruit-forward citrus flavors 
                or taste of resin and pine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "beer-style">
            <h3>Sour Ale</h3>
            <p>An ancient style of beer that's taken off in popularity in recent years, sour ales are crafted from wild yeasts, much like sourdough bread. 
                These beers are known for a tart tang that pairs well with tropical fruit and spices. Within sour beers, you'll find lambics, 
                which are Belgian sour beers mixed with fruit, goses, a German sour beer made with coriander and sea salt, and Flanders, 
                a Belgian sour beer fermented in wood tanks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "beer-style">
            <h3>Wheat</h3>
            <p>An easy-drinking, light style of beer, wheat beers are known for a soft, smooth flavor and a hazy body. 
                Wheat beers tend to taste like spices or citrus, with the hefeweizen or unfiltered wheat beer being one of the more common styles.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "beer-style">
            <h3>Porter</h3>
            <p>A type of ale, porter beers are known for their dark black color and roasted malt aroma and notes. Porters may be fruity or dry in flavor, 
                which is determined by the variety of roasted malt used in the brewing process.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Stout</h3>
            <p>Like porters, stouts are dark, roasted ales. Stouts taste less sweet than porters and often feature a bitter coffee taste, 
                which comes from unmalted roasted barley that is added to the wort. They are characterized by a thick, creamy head.</p>

            <h3>ABV</h3>
            Alcohol by volume (ABV) is a metric used to determine the alcohol content in an alcoholic beverage. 
            The measurement shows what percentage of the beverage’s total volume is pure alcohol.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>IBU</h3>
            IBU stands for International Bitterness Units, a scale to gauge the level of a beer’s bitterness. 
            More specifically, IBUs measure the parts per million of isohumulone from hops in a beer, which gives beer bitterness. 
            The IBU scale can range from 0 to 120+, but at this point, the human tongue can’t taste any more bitterness.
